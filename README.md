# WinUI-Samples

Welcome to the WinUI-Samples repository! This repository contains a collection of tutorials and samples for WinUI 3, a modern UI framework for building Windows apps. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find a wealth of resources here to help you learn and explore the capabilities of WinUI 3.

## What is WinUI?

WinUI (Windows UI Library) is a native user interface framework for building modern, high-performance Windows apps. It provides a set of controls and APIs that enable developers to create visually appealing, fast, and fluid user experiences across a wide range of Windows devices.

WinUI 3 is the latest version of the framework and represents a major update over its predecessor, WinUI 2. With WinUI 3, you can build Windows apps that target both the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and the Desktop (Win32) platforms, using a shared codebase.
